                      <p>Zander joined the Product Co-op to help early-stage founders iterate to product-market fit. It's a challenge he recently faced (and will never be done tackling). He believes it’s the most important thing to get right in a company's infancy, and that early-stage founders would be well-advised to lean on a network of experienced, product-focused operators who have already cleared this hurdle. He’s excited to be one of them.</p>
